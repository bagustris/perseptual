# Perseptual - Human Perceptual Systems and Models

This repository contains lecture notes (in Indonesian/Bahasa Indonesia) from the course **I645: Human Perceptual Systems and its Models**, focusing primarily on auditory perception and the human hearing system.

## About

These notes cover various aspects of human sensory perception with a strong emphasis on auditory physiology, psychoacoustics, signal processing, and computational models of human hearing. The materials explore how humans perceive sound, from the physical mechanics of the ear to cognitive processing in the brain.
